## Description

I've been tasked with making a budget-tracker that saves expenses and deposits to their budget with or without being online.
If they enter while being offline, it will be stored ready for when they connect online.

Ive done this by doing;

- allowing deposits/expenses to be input offline
- offline entries added when brought back online

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:Cratesy/budget-tracker.git
cd budget-tracker
npm install
```

## Usage

As a user i would like to input deposits/expenses to track my daily balance.
I can enter my deposits/expenses wether offline or online, if im offline it should keep them and store them when im online again.
